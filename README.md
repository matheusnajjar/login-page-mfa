## Project Overview

The **Login Page with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** project is a React-based application that simulates a secure login process. After logging in with email and password, users can select a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) option (via text message or email) and enter an authentication code. This project showcases a simple front-end simulation of an MFA system without actual backend integration, making it perfect for educational purposes or initial prototyping.
